            <h1>A Peek Into My Childhood</h1>
            <h2>Quezon Memorial Circle<h2> 
            
            <p class = "psize">The Quezon Memorial Circle, a national park situated in Quezon City, Philippines is a prominent landmark located within a large elliptical traffic circle bounded by the Elliptical Road. Serving as the main park of Quezon City, which was the official capital of the Philippines from 1948 to 1976, the park is renowned for its centerpiece: a 66-meter (217 ft) tall mausoleum.</p>    
            <p class = "psize">Originally planned as the National Capitol site, the Quezon Memorial Circle was part of the National Government Center, but construction halted in 1940 due to World War II. In 1945, President Sergio Osmeña formed the Quezon Memorial Committee to honor President Manuel L. Quezon. Former Mayor Tomas Morato opposed relocating the monument, resigning in protest. In 1951, architect Federico Ilustre design, including a museum and theater, won a national contest. The site hosted major events, including Pope Paul VI 1970 mass. After the 1986 People Power Revolution, the Quezon City Parks Development Foundation (QCPDF) managed the park until turning it over to the city government in 2008. </p>
            <p class = "psize">Circle of Fun at Quezon Memorial Circle is one of the most special places from my childhood. It was not just a theme park to me—it was where my Father, my <i>Tatay</i> made the little me happy. Whenever I got good grades, he would take me there to celebrate, turning an ordinary day into something more. There's this specific memory I can&#39;t forget, there was a small roller coaster for kids. This gonna be sounds cliche, but what I remember most wasn&#39;t just the ride itself—it was my Tatay standing on the side, watching me. I&#39;d look for him, and there he was, smiling so warmly, his eyes full of joy. He was really there with me, sharing in my happiness. That smile of his made me feel so loved, like he was just as excited as I was, even though he wasn&#39;t the one on the ride. it wasn&#39;t the ride that made those moments unforgettable—it was my Tatay&#39;s smile.</p>
